# webapp-vue-template

I'm still trying to get things setup. There are still more pieces of the infrastructere that need to be put in place.

create project folder

{
  "name": "my-app",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nuxt",
    "build": "nuxt build",
    "generate": "nuxt generate",
    "start": "nuxt start"
  }
}
create package.json from code above.

npm install nuxt
